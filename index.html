<p>CleverLeaf is a hydrodynamics mini-app that extends
<a href="http://warwick-pcav.github.io/CloverLeaf/">CloverLeaf</a> with Adaptive Mesh
Refinement using the
<a href="http://computation.llnl.gov/casc/SAMRAI/index.html">SAMRAI</a> toolkit from
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. The primary goal of CleverLeaf is to
evaluate the application of AMR to the Lagrangian-Eulerian hydrodynamics scheme
used by CloverLeaf.</p>

<p>Like CloverLeaf, CleverLeaf solves Euler's equations on a staggered grid,
using an explicit, second-order accurate method. Each cell stores three
values: energy, density, and pressure. A velocity vector is stored at each
cell corner. The equations are solved in two dimensions. The following
description of the equations is from the CloverLeaf documentation:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The compressible Euler equations are a set of three partial
differential equations that describe the conservation of energy, mass and
momentum in a system. CloverLeaf produces a second-order accurate solution
using explicit finite volume methods. It first performs a Lagrangian step,
using a predictor-corrector scheme to advance the solution forward by a
calculated time delta. This step causes the mesh to move with fluid
velocity, so an advective remap is used in order to return the mesh to its
original state. A second-order Van Leer scheme is used, with the advective
sweep being performed in the x and y directions for the energy, mass and
momentum. The initial sweep direction alternates between steps, providing
second order accuracy. The flow direction mush be calculated during the
remap to allow data from the "upwind" direction to be used. Although the
deformation of the grid does not actually move cell vertices, the average
velocity on a cell face is used to approximate a flux through each face for
the advection of material.</p>

<p>The compressible Euler equations form a hyperbolic system and therefore
generate discontinuities in the form of shock waves. The second-order
approximation will fail at these discontinuities and cause "ringing" in the
solution. To avoid this, an artificial viscous pressure is used, which makes
the solution first order in the presence of shock waves.  This preserves
monotonicity in the solution, by behaving as a simple addition to the
pressure.</p>

<p>The timestep control uses the maximum sound speed as an upper bound for the
time delta. The timestep is thus limited to the time it would take for the
the highest speed sound wave to cross a cell. The timestep is then
multiplied by a safety factor to preserve the stability of the solution. The
timestep control contains two further tests: one to ensure that a vertex
can't overtake another as the mesh deforms, and one to ensure that a cell
cannot deform such that it's volume becomes negative.</p>

<p>In order to close the system of equations, we use an equation of state,
which calculates the pressure and sound speed in a cell, given its energy
and density.  CloverLeaf uses the ideal gas equation of state with a gamma
value of 1.4. </p>

<p>Currently, CloverLeaf only solves for a single material, although multiple
states (pressures, densities, and velocities) of this material can exist in
the problem domain. Support for multiple materials will be added into a
future release.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The physics in CleverLeaf uses the Fortran kernel functions written for
CloverLeaf, and applies them to each patch in the adaptive hierarchy.  Control
code has been added which adapts the grid and synchronises the different levels
of refinement. To coarsen the field variables, two additional operators have
been added to conservatively coarsen energy and pressure.</p>

<p>Cells are tagged based on three criteria: energy gradient, density gradient,
and artificial viscosity value. Please see <code>Cleverleaf.h</code> for further
documentation on how to control this tagging.</p>
