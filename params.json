{"name":"Cleverleaf","tagline":"CleverLeaf reference version - AMR mini-app/mini-driver using the SAMRAI library","body":"# CleverLeaf\r\n\r\nCleverLeaf is a hydrodynamics mini-app that extends\r\n[CloverLeaf](http://warwick-pcav.github.io/CloverLeaf/) with Adaptive Mesh\r\nRefinement using the\r\n[SAMRAI](http://computation.llnl.gov/casc/SAMRAI/index.html) toolkit from\r\nLawrence Livermore National Laboratory. The primary goal of CleverLeaf is to\r\nevaluate the application of AMR to the Lagrangian-Eulerian hydrodynamics scheme\r\nused by CloverLeaf.\r\n\r\nLike CloverLeaf, CleverLeaf solves Euler's equations on a staggered grid,\r\nusing an explicit, second-order accurate method. Each cell stores three\r\nvalues: energy, density, and pressure. A velocity vector is stored at each\r\ncell corner. The equations are solved in two dimensions. The following\r\ndescription of the equations is from the CloverLeaf documentation:\r\n\r\n> The compressible Euler equations are a set of three partial\r\n> differential equations that describe the conservation of energy, mass and\r\n> momentum in a system. CloverLeaf produces a second-order accurate solution\r\n> using explicit finite volume methods. It first performs a Lagrangian step,\r\n> using a predictor-corrector scheme to advance the solution forward by a\r\n> calculated time delta. This step causes the mesh to move with fluid\r\n> velocity, so an advective remap is used in order to return the mesh to its\r\n> original state. A second-order Van Leer scheme is used, with the advective\r\n> sweep being performed in the x and y directions for the energy, mass and\r\n> momentum. The initial sweep direction alternates between steps, providing\r\n> second order accuracy. The flow direction mush be calculated during the\r\n> remap to allow data from the \"upwind\" direction to be used. Although the\r\n> deformation of the grid does not actually move cell vertices, the average\r\n> velocity on a cell face is used to approximate a flux through each face for\r\n> the advection of material.\r\n> \r\n> The compressible Euler equations form a hyperbolic system and therefore\r\n> generate discontinuities in the form of shock waves. The second-order\r\n> approximation will fail at these discontinuities and cause \"ringing\" in the\r\n> solution. To avoid this, an artificial viscous pressure is used, which makes\r\n> the solution first order in the presence of shock waves.  This preserves\r\n> monotonicity in the solution, by behaving as a simple addition to the\r\n> pressure.\r\n> \r\n> The timestep control uses the maximum sound speed as an upper bound for the\r\n> time delta. The timestep is thus limited to the time it would take for the\r\n> the highest speed sound wave to cross a cell. The timestep is then\r\n> multiplied by a safety factor to preserve the stability of the solution. The\r\n> timestep control contains two further tests: one to ensure that a vertex\r\n> can't overtake another as the mesh deforms, and one to ensure that a cell\r\n> cannot deform such that it's volume becomes negative.\r\n> \r\n> In order to close the system of equations, we use an equation of state,\r\n> which calculates the pressure and sound speed in a cell, given its energy\r\n> and density.  CloverLeaf uses the ideal gas equation of state with a gamma\r\n> value of 1.4. \r\n> \r\n> Currently, CloverLeaf only solves for a single material, although multiple\r\n> states (pressures, densities, and velocities) of this material can exist in\r\n> the problem domain. Support for multiple materials will be added into a\r\n> future release.\r\n\r\nThe physics in CleverLeaf uses the Fortran kernel functions written for\r\nCloverLeaf, and applies them to each patch in the adaptive hierarchy.  Control\r\ncode has been added which adapts the grid and synchronises the different levels\r\nof refinement. To coarsen the field variables, two additional operators have\r\nbeen added to conservatively coarsen energy and pressure.\r\n\r\nCells are tagged based on three criteria: energy gradient, density gradient,\r\nand artificial viscosity value. Please see `Cleverleaf.h` for further\r\ndocumentation on how to control this tagging.\r\n\r\n## Further Documentation\r\n\r\nAll header files contain detailed comments, and the `make doc` target can be\r\nused to build the documentation using Doxygen.
