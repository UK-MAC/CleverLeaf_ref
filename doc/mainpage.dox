/** @mainpage CleverLeaf Source Code Documentation
 *
 * CleverLeaf is a hydrodynamics mini-app that extends <a
 * href="http://warwick-pcav.github.io/CloverLeaf/">CloverLeaf</a> with
 * Adaptive Mesh Refinement using the <a
 * href="http://computation.llnl.gov/casc/SAMRAI/index.html">SAMRAI</a> toolkit
 * from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.
 *
 * \section About
 *
 * Like CloverLeaf, CleverLeaf solves Euler's equations on a staggered grid,
 * using an explicit, second-order accurate method. Each cell stores three
 * values: energy, density, and pressure. A velocity vector is stored at each
 * cell corner. The equations are solved in two dimensions. The following
 * description of the equations is from the CloverLeaf documentation:
 *
 * <blockquote>The compressible Euler equations are a set of three partial
 * differential equations that describe the conservation of energy, mass and
 * momentum in a system. CloverLeaf produces a second-order accurate solution
 * using explicit finite volume methods. It first performs a Lagrangian step,
 * using a predictor-corrector scheme to advance the solution forward by a
 * calculated time delta. This step causes the mesh to move with fluid
 * velocity, so an advective remap is used in order to return the mesh to its
 * original state. A second-order Van Leer scheme is used, with the advective
 * sweep being performed in the x and y directions for the energy, mass and
 * momentum. The initial sweep direction alternates between steps, providing
 * second order accuracy. The flow direction mush be calculated during the
 * remap to allow data from the "upwind" direction to be used. Although the
 * deformation of the grid does not actually move cell vertices, the average
 * velocity on a cell face is used to approximate a flux through each face for
 * the advection of material.
 * 
 * The compressible Euler equations form a hyperbolic system and therefore
 * generate discontinuities in the form of shock waves. The second-order
 * approximation will fail at these discontinuities and cause "ringing" in the
 * solution. To avoid this, an artificial viscous pressure is used, which makes
 * the solution first order in the presence of shock waves.  This preserves
 * monotonicity in the solution, by behaving as a simple addition to the
 * pressure.
 * 
 * The timestep control uses the maximum sound speed as an upper bound for the
 * time delta. The timestep is thus limited to the time it would take for the
 * the highest speed sound wave to cross a cell. The timestep is then
 * multiplied by a safety factor to preserve the stability of the solution. The
 * timestep control contains two further tests: one to ensure that a vertex
 * can't overtake another as the mesh deforms, and one to ensure that a cell
 * cannot deform such that it's volume becomes negative.
 * 
 * In order to close the system of equations, we use an equation of state,
 * which calculates the pressure and sound speed in a cell, given its energy
 * and density.  CloverLeaf uses the ideal gas equation of state with a gamma
 * value of 1.4. 
 * 
 * Currently, CloverLeaf only solves for a single material, although multiple
 * states (pressures, densities, and velocities) of this material can exist in
 * the problem domain. Support for multiple materials will be added into a
 * future release.</blockquote>
 * 
 * \section Design
 *
 * The code is split into three main classes: LagrangianEulerianIntegrator,
 * which is responsible for advancing the solution across the entire adaptive
 * grid; LagrangianEulerianLevelIntegrator, which is responsible for advancing
 * the solution on a single level; and Cleverleaf, which implements the
 * LagrangianEulerianPatchStrategy interface, providing the methods needed to
 * advance the solution on a single patch.
 *
 * The physics in CleverLeaf uses the Fortran kernel functions written for
 * CloverLeaf, and applies them to each patch in the adaptive hierarchy.
 * Control code has been added which adapts the grid and synchronises the
 * different levels of refinement. To coarsen the field variables, two
 * additional operators have been added:
 * CartesianCellDoubleMassWeightedAverage, and
 * CartesianCellDoubleVolumeWeightedAverage. These are used to conservatively
 * coarsen energy and pressure.
